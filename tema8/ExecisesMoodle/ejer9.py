#9) Write a program to manage a phone book with the names and phone numbers of the customers of a store. The program should handle functions to create the file with the phone book if it does not exist, to consult the phone number of a customer, add a new customer's phone number and delete a customer's phone number.  The list should be stored in the text file telephone_list.txt where the name of the customer and his phone number should be separated by commas and each customer on a separate line.
